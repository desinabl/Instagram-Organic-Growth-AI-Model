## Project Overview
The Instagram Organic Growth AI Model is designed to help users grow their Instagram accounts organically by targeting relevant audiences and automating certain actions. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze Instagram data and provide recommendations for effective growth strategies.

## Features
- Influencer and Competitor Targeting: Identify relevant influencers and competitors to engage with and gain visibility among their followers.
- Account Targeting: Find accounts that are likely to be interested in your content based on their interests and engagement patterns.
- Hashtag Targeting: Discover popular and relevant hashtags to use in your posts for increased reach and discoverability.
- Location Targeting: Target users based on specific locations to reach a local audience. (Coming Soon)
- Follow/Unfollow Automation: Automate the process of following and unfollowing accounts based on predefined criteria.
- Like After Follow: Automatically like posts of followed accounts to increase engagement and potential followbacks.
- Analytics Dashboard: Track and visualize growth metrics, follower demographics, and content performance.
